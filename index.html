That’s a pretty bold statement, but these apples have backed it up.After celebrating the 40th birthday of the apples in 2014, they are still the most expensive in the entire world. The average fruit has a circumference of 15 inches, so their waist lines are almost bigger than some supermodels. They also weigh around two pounds each, so you can do some damage with them. Average apple cost at your local market? Around $0.85 each.",

You have seen the perfect strawberry at your local market, the one that is red all the way through with a dark green leaf at the top and has the seeds of pure white popping out from the skin. It’s mouthwatering just thinking about it.",

In 2014, these square watermelons were finally shipped to countries outside of Japan, but they come at a high price. They are grown in a box, which forces them to take the square shape. That only works with fruit, so don’t try to make a square person.",

Pineapple pits aren’t quite common in Europe, as Heligan has the only one left in the entire continent. To keep the pit going, two giant mud structures are based in rotting manure to help the pineapples grow and stay ripe.",

For those that do love the taste, then the Yubari King is the top of the line in the family of orange melons. You can only find these bad boys on the Hokkaido island near Sapporo, and the Yubari is a result of a hybrid between two other sweet cantaloupes.",
